# 8-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

## Description

This project involves the design and implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The ALU is capable of performing a range of arithmetic and logical operations, including addition, subtraction, bitwise operations, and comparisons.

## Project Goals

- **Design and Implement**: Create an 8-bit ALU capable of various operations.
- **Simulate and Verify**: Use a testbench to ensure correct functionality of the ALU.
- **Enhance Skills**: Develop proficiency in Verilog and digital logic design.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition and subtraction with carry-out and overflow detection.
- **Logical Operations**: AND, OR, XOR, NOR, NAND, XNOR.
- **Shift Operations**: Left and right shifts.
- **Comparison Operations**: Less than, equal to, greater than, not equal to, greater or equal to, less or equal to.
- **Flag Outputs**: Carry-out, zero, and overflow flags.

## Simulation Results
